# ProjectFreeman
A game meant to be something like the board game risk

Project Freeman began as a game meant to be a spin off of the board game Risk. The name Project Freeman was meant to be a code name before an actual name existed. I was the sole developer for the game writing all code involved, while my friend James wrote much of the plans, and my friend Dylan did the artwork. Basically each player would join a game and start with ownership of a single country, and their objective would be to become more powerful than the other empires and overthrow them. This could be done through different attacking methods, boosting your own economy and through other methods all with the purpose of obtaining supreme power. Players have the option of joining many games that are in progress where they can send messages to each other in game, and interact by the actual game play. I made this game a few years back but never completed it as the actual planning of the gameplay just seemed to be a mess and I never got back into it with my friends. I used libgdx for the game as well for both the launcher and the game. Scene2D was used for the UI in both launcher and game. Since it is not truly finished I offer no download links but feel free to download and compile the source code.
